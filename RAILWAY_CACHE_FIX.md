# üö® URGENT: Railway Cache Issue Fix

## Problem:
Railway is using a **cached old version** of the Dockerfile that has the wrong COPY command.

## Solution 1: Clear Build Cache in Railway (RECOMMENDED)

### Steps:
1. **Go to Railway Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project
2. **Click on your service**
3. **Go to "Settings" tab**
4. **Scroll down to find "Danger Zone"** or **"Advanced"**
5. **Look for "Clear Build Cache"** or **"Reset Service"**
6. **Click it** to clear the cache
7. **Redeploy** - Click "Redeploy" button

## Solution 2: Delete and Recreate Service

If clearing cache doesn't work:

1. **Delete the current service** in Railway
2. **Create a NEW service**:
   - Click "New" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select: `Hiteshydv001/Internship-assesment`
   - Railway will use the NEW Dockerfile
3. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   FLASK_ENV=production
   ```

## Solution 3: Force Rebuild with Empty Commit

In your terminal:

```powershell
# Add an empty commit to force rebuild
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Railway rebuild - clear cache"
git push
```

Then in Railway dashboard, click **"Redeploy"**.

## What Was Fixed:

‚úÖ Dockerfile now correctly does: `COPY backend/ /app/`
‚úÖ Then installs from: `/app/requirements.txt`
‚úÖ Added `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files

## Expected Build Success:

Once cache is cleared, Railway will:
- ‚úÖ Use the NEW Dockerfile
- ‚úÖ Copy backend files correctly
- ‚úÖ Find requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Build successfully
- ‚úÖ Deploy your app!

## Quick Check:

After redeploying, the build logs should show:
```
COPY backend/ /app/
```

NOT:
```
COPY requirements.txt .   ‚ùå (old cached version)
```

**Try Solution 1 first (Clear Build Cache), then Solution 2 if needed!**
